# R Practice 2 / June 25, 2025

## Part 1 - In Class Demo

# load the pre-installed state dataset
data(state)
# convert it to a useable form
state = as.data.frame(state.x77)
# add the region variable
state$region = state.region
# add the division variable
state$division = state.division

# take a quick look at the dataset

# make a histogram of population

# make a boxplot of population

# make a table of region

# make a barchart of region

# make a piechart of region

## Part 2 - Practice

# make at least two categorical graphs and four numeric graphs
# add titles, colors, and labels!

# can you figure out how to make a boxplot vertical?

# can you figure out how to make each pieve a different color in a histogram, bar, or pie?
