## Part 2 - Practice

# Math Functions: + - * / %% abs sqrt exp log log10
# Vector Functions: sum, length, mean, median, min, max, rep, seq, sample

# Create a variable called x that is an integer

# Create a variable called y that is a number with a decimal

# Create a variable called xroot that is the square root of x

# Create a variable called ln_y that is ln(y)

# Create a variable called rem that is the remainder of dividing 72 by 7

# Create a vector called vec that contains all 5 of the previously created variables

# Print out the following vectors using functions, do not hard code the values
# (1, 2, 3, . . . , 19, 20)

# (20, 19, . . . , 2, 1)

# (1, 2, 3, . . . , 19, 20, 19, 18, . . . , 2, 1)

# (4, 6, 3) and assign it to the name tmp

# (4, 6, 3, 4, 6, 3, . . . , 4, 6, 3) where there are 10 occurrences of 4.

# (4, 6, 3, 4, 6, 3, . . . , 4, 6, 3, 4) where there are 11 occurrences of 4, 10 occurrences of 6 and 10 occurrences of 3.

# (4, 4, . . . , 4, 6, 6, . . . , 6, 3, 3, . . . , 3) where there are 10 occurrences of 4, 20 occurrences of 6 and 30 occurrences of 3.

# Create a vector called random that has 50 random values from 1 through 1000

# Find the average of random without using the mean() function

# Find the maximum value in random

# Find the minimum value in random

# Create a vector of 5 student names

# Create a vector of 5 ages

# Use the paste command to print out the name and age of each student in the format, "NAME is AGE years old"
