  # A vector that starts at 50, goes down by 5, and stops at 5

  # A vector that repeats the numbers (2, 4, 6) 15 times in a row

  # A vector that repeats: sixteen 2s in a row then ten 4s in a row then ten 6s in a row

# Create a vector called rand_nums containing 30 random integers from 1 to 100 (allow repeats).

# Find the mean, median, and max of rand_nums

# Create a vector with 5 grocery items

# Create a vector with 5 prices
